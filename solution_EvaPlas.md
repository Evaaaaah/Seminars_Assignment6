## Visualization of data
![A graph showing the beer consumption and WO from 2006 to 2018.](plot.png "Data from the csv-file.")
Since the csv-file is called 'istherecorrelation.csv', I expect that there seems to be a correlation in this data, but that they're not actually connected. (I have no idea what WO means, so this data is pretty disconnected for me anyways.) Both rise with each year, but there is nothing to suggest that one causes the other.
